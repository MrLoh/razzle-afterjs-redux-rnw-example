# Razzle + After.js + Redux + React Native Web Example

Install it and run:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

## Idea behind the example

This is a basic, bare-bones example of how to use After.js and Razzle with React Native Web.

The project itself is derived from [create-razzle-app --example with-afterjs](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tree/next/examples/with-afterjs)
combined with [create-razzle-app --example with-redux](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tree/next/examples/with-redux) and [create-razzle-app --example with-react-native-web](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/razzle/tree/next/examples/with-react-native-web)
